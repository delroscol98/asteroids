# asteroids

Asteroids is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## How to use

1. Download all the files from [Github](https://github.com/delroscol98/asteroids)
2. From the root directory in the terminal, type the following command `uv run main.py`
3. Shoot as many asteroids as you want

## What I learned 

This project is a clone of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts. This project helped me understand how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handler user input, and manage game state. I also learned how to use object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions.

### Future Development

I want to tinker in this project more and more and add the following:

- High score leaderboard
- A menu that welcomes the user and is able to choose between different modes
- Multiplayer with asteroids in between
- Different levels with different enemies and strengths
- Different weapons to choose from

## My build process

### 1. Pygame
Set and install pygame

### 2. Player
Create a Player class and implement movement

### 3. Asteroids
Add asteroids for the player to avoid

### 4. Score
Render a score tracker to count the number of asteroids destroyed

### 5. Update UI
Use actual images rather than shapes to prettify the game experience.
